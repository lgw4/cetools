# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Always add the comment 'This file contains GitHub Copilot generated content.' at the end of every file containing content generated by GitHub Copilot. This comment should follow the comment formatting of the filetype of each file affected. There should only be one such comment in each file in which there is GitHub Copilot generated content.
- Follow the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Include comments and documentation where necessary.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Prefer more straightforward or simple code over more complex or clever code.

## GitHub Copilot Guidelines

- When we are working on a project specification, please create a file named `project-specification.md` inside a directory named `copilot-documents` at the top level of the repository. The `project-specification.md` file should be in well-formatted Markdown format.
- When we are working on a project implementation plan, please create a file named `project-implementation.md` inside a directory named `copilot-documents` at the top level of the repository. The `project-implementation.md` file should be in well-formatted Markdown format.
- Keep a log of all changes you make to files in this project in a text file named `copilot-operations.log` inside a directory named `copilot-documents` at the top level of the repository. Please use full timestamps (not only dates, but dates and times) in ISO 8601 format when logging changes (for example: 2025-08-31T22:50:00Z). The most recent log entries should be at the top of the file (that is, log entries should be sorted in descending order).

## Repository Guidelines

- For any directory in the project that contains only other directories and no files, create an empty `.keep` file in that directory so it displays properly in the GitHub web UI.
- When naming YAML files, always use the `.yaml` filename extension (not the `.yml` filename extension).

## Tool Preferences

## Command Runner

- We use [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) for project-level automation (such as build automation).

## Python

- Use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python virtual environment and Python dependency management.
- Use `pyproject.toml` for configuring all Python-related tools (such as Black) that support it.
- Use Python >= 3.13.

## Shell Scripts

- All shell commands or scripts (including examples in project documentation) should be in Bourne shell (or Bash shell, if necessary) format.

## Versioning

- Use [`bumpver`](https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver) for versioning this project. Use C[CalVer](https://calver.org) for this project.
