2025-08-31T23:59:59Z - Implemented Dice module (step 3): added `src/cetools/dice/__init__.py` implementing `roll(expression: str, seed: int|None) -> RollResult` with deterministic seeding, comma-separated expressions support, a MAX_DICE guard, and JSON-serializable `RollResult`; added unit tests `tests/test_dice.py`; removed duplicate file `src/cetools/dice.py` to fix import conflict. Attempted test runs and resolved import-on-collection errors by moving implementation into the `dice` package.
2025-08-31T23:59:50Z - Switched `pyproject.toml` build backend to `hatchling` and updated `pyproject.toml` to avoid using `setuptools` per user request.
2025-08-31T23:59:30Z - Added `copilot-documents/project-specification.md` with project requirements, APIs, data models, and next steps per specification prompt; prefer Black for formatting.
2025-08-31T23:59:00Z - Implemented bootstrap step: updated `pyproject.toml` with dev extras and console script placeholder, added `justfile`, and expanded `README.md` with uv/just instructions.
2025-08-31T23:41:14Z - Updated `copilot-documents/project-implementation.md` to prefer Pydantic v2 for data models.
2025-08-31T23:38:08Z - Updated `copilot-documents/project-implementation.md` to use Typer for CLI instead of argparse.
2025-08-31T23:33:44Z - Created `copilot-documents/project-implementation.md` containing the implementation plan for cetools.
2025-08-31T23:26:17Z - Created `copilot-documents/project-specification.md` containing the initial project specification for cetools.
