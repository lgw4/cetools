2025-09-08T01:45:00Z - Implemented Phase 1, Step 2 of the project implementation plan: Created comprehensive CLI command structure using typer. Added main command groups (character, npc, encounter, world) with all subcommands as specified in project specification. Implemented hierarchical command structure with sub-apps for animal encounters, patron encounters, and subsector commands. All commands have proper help text and argument parsing but contain placeholder implementations for future phases.
2025-09-08T01:15:00Z - Removed unnecessary hexadecimal handling from pseudo-hexadecimal implementation. Cepheus Engine pseudo-hex notation is independent of standard hexadecimal, so removed "0x" prefix handling from normalize_pseudo_hex function and related tests.
2025-09-08T01:00:00Z - Refactored pseudo-hexadecimal implementation to use Python dictionaries instead of string indexing. This makes the code more explicit, maintainable, and less error-prone. Added DEC_TO_PSEUDO_HEX and PSEUDO_HEX_TO_DEC constants for clearer mapping.
2025-09-08T00:30:00Z - Fixed pseudo-hexadecimal implementation to correctly follow official Cepheus Engine SRD specification. Updated sequence to exclude I and O as specified, with Q=24 and Z=33. Fixed tests to match the official specification rather than incorrect expectations.
2025-09-07T23:15:00Z - Updated pseudo-hexadecimal implementation to support full A-Z range (values 10-35) instead of just A-F (values 10-15) to match Cepheus Engine SRD specification. Updated all functions and tests accordingly.
2025-09-07T22:50:00Z - Fixed failing test in test_normalize_pseudo_hex by modifying normalize_pseudo_hex function to preserve numeric strings as-is instead of converting through decimal
2025-09-07T10:45:00Z - Updated `pyproject.toml`: replaced setuptools with hatchling as the build system.
2025-09-07T10:30:00Z - Implemented Phase 1, Step 1 of the project implementation plan: created project directory structure, initialized Python package, configured pyproject.toml with dependencies and tools (black, flake8, bumpver), implemented core utilities for pseudo-hex conversion and configuration management, updated README with installation and usage instructions, and added initial test files.
2025-09-07T06:15:45Z - Created and formatted `project-implementation.md` with detailed implementation plan based on `project-specification.md`. Organized plan into 5 steps with 8 phases, each step achievable within 40 work hours.
2025-09-07T05:51:40Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: added CLI deliverables: `encounter animal gen`, `encounter patron gen`, `world create`, and `subsector create`.
2025-09-07T04:45:00Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: added subsector/world creation and new encounter generators (animal and patron) to Major Features; documented CLI commands and export behavior.
2025-09-07T04:25:30Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: added `flake8` as the Python linter and retained `black` for formatting.
2025-09-07T04:09:55Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: removed `ruff` and set formatting tool to `black` only.
2025-09-07T03:58:10Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: changed core model recommendation to use `pydantic`.
2025-09-07T03:41:20Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: added requirement that the roll parser supports Cepheus-style D66 rolls (including optional unordered variant) and is seedable; documented behavior and CLI options.
2025-09-07T03:28:45Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: set CLI argument parsing and validation to use `typer` (type-driven, Click-compatible).
2025-09-07T03:05:12Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: converted example character JSON numeric fields to SRD pseudo-hexadecimal notation (A=10, B=11, C=12).
2025-09-07T02:44:05Z - Updated `project-specification.md`: added requirement that output values use Cepheus SRD pseudo-hexadecimal notation; added guidance for accepting and normalizing inputs.
2025-09-07T01:30:00Z - Created project specification document
