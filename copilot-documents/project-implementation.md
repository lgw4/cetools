# Cepheus Engine Tools — Implementation Plan

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step approach to build the Cepheus Engine Tools project as defined in the project specification. Each step is designed to be achievable by a single software engineer with an agentic LLM coding assistant within forty work hours or less.

## Step 1: Project Setup and Core Foundation (40 hours)

   - Set up Python project with `pyproject.toml` for Python ≥ 3.13
   - Configure `uv` for dependency management
   - Configure linting (`flake8`) and formatting (`black`) in `pyproject.toml`
   - Set up versioning with `bumpver` (CalVer)
   - Create initial project documentation and README
   - Create `.keep` files for empty directories

2. **Basic Project Structure**
   - Create package structure: `cetools.core` and `cetools.cli`
   - Set up `typer` for CLI argument parsing
   - Implement CLI entrypoint and command registration
   - Create configuration management for storing user settings in `~/.config/cetools/config.toml`

### Phase 2 (20 hours)

1. **Core Data Models and Utilities**
   - Implement `pydantic` models for Characters, NPCs, Items, etc.
   - Create utility functions for pseudo-hexadecimal notation conversion
   - Implement serialization/deserialization for JSON, YAML, and CSV exports
   - Build configuration management and XDG path handling

2. **Roll Parser Implementation**
   - Develop the dice expression parser
   - Implement the roll engine with support for:
     - Standard dice notation (2d6+3, etc.)
     - Cepheus-style D66 rolls (including unordered variant)
     - Advantage/disadvantage mechanisms
     - Seedable RNG for reproducible results
   - Create comprehensive tests for the roll parser

## Step 2: Character and NPC Generation (40 hours)

### Phase 1 (20 hours)

1. **Character Creation Core**
   - Implement the character generation rules from Cepheus SRD
   - Create character templates and customization options
   - Build attribute generation and skill allocation mechanisms
   - Implement equipment and gear assignment

2. **Character Persistence and Export**
   - Create storage mechanisms for character data
   - Implement export functionality in multiple formats (JSON, YAML, CSV)
   - Add import capabilities for existing character data

### Phase 2 (20 hours)

1. **NPC Generation**
   - Implement NPC generation with customizable templates
   - Create NPC complexity levels and appropriate scaling
   - Add NPC-specific attributes, motivations, and behaviors
   - Implement specialized NPC types (patrons, enemies, allies)

2. **CLI Commands for Characters and NPCs**
   - Build the `cetools character create` command
   - Create the `cetools npc gen` command
   - Implement help documentation and usage examples
   - Add comprehensive tests for character and NPC generation

## Step 3: World and Encounter Generation (40 hours)

### Phase 3 (20 hours)

1. **World and Subsector Creation**
   - Implement world generation rules from Cepheus SRD
   - Create subsector generation with interconnected star systems
   - Add trade routes and economic factors
   - Implement seedable generation for consistent results

2. **World Data Models and Export**
   - Create data models for worlds, star systems, and subsectors
   - Implement export functionality for world data
   - Add visualization options for subsector maps (ASCII/text-based)

### Phase 4 (20 hours)

1. **Encounter Generation**
   - Implement animal encounter generation based on world parameters
   - Create patron encounter generation with motivations and hooks
   - Build encounter balancing mechanism based on party composition
   - Add reward and challenge scaling

2. **CLI Commands for Worlds and Encounters**
   - Build the `cetools world create` and `cetools subsector create` commands
   - Create the `cetools encounter animal gen` and `cetools encounter patron gen` commands
   - Implement the `cetools encounter balance` command
   - Add comprehensive tests for world and encounter generation

## Step 4: SRD Lookup and System Integration (40 hours)

### Phase 5 (20 hours)

1. **SRD Data Indexing**
   - Create a local index of the Cepheus SRD
   - Implement efficient search functionality
   - Build caching mechanism for SRD data
   - Create data structure for quick term lookups

2. **SRD Lookup Implementation**
   - Implement the `cetools srlookup` command
   - Create text formatting for human-readable output
   - Add JSON output option for machine consumption
   - Implement fuzzy matching for user-friendly searches

### Phase 6 (20 hours)

1. **System Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate all components into a cohesive system
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add logging and debugging capabilities
   - Create integration tests for end-to-end functionality

2. **Packaging and Distribution**
   - Set up Python package for distribution
   - Create installation instructions
   - Generate user documentation
   - Prepare for release on PyPI

## Step 5: Documentation, Optimization, and Polish (40 hours)

### Phase 7 (20 hours)

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Write user guides and tutorials
   - Add usage examples for each command
   - Document configuration options and customization

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize critical code paths
   - Improve memory usage for large data sets
   - Enhance startup time for CLI commands
   - Optimize file I/O operations

### Phase 8 (20 hours)

1. **Quality Assurance and Testing**
   - Expand test coverage across all modules
   - Create property-based tests for complex operations
   - Implement stress tests for large-scale operations
   - Add edge case handling and tests

2. **Final Polish and Preparation**
   - Refine user experience based on feedback
   - Add helpful error messages and suggestions
   - Create a change log and release notes
   - Prepare for initial release and community feedback

## Future Expansion (Post-MVP)

- RESTful API implementation via HTTP adapter
- Web UI for easier access
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Additional generators and tools
- Support for house rules and custom content

This implementation plan is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments as development progresses. Each step builds upon the previous ones, creating a cohesive and well-structured system that meets the requirements specified in the project specification document.
